# ü§ñ QuattroMan

## üß≠ Overview  
**QuattroMan** is an AI Agent developed for Quattro Constructors, initially built using Microsoft Power Virtual Agents and later upgraded and migrated to **Microsoft Copilot Studio**. It functions as a company-wide virtual assistant that provides answers to common questions, integrates with internal systems via API, and automates actions using Power Automate.

The agent is embedded in **Microsoft Teams** and within the **Quattrofy Web App**, enabling users (field and office-based) to interact with the AI in a centralized, secure, and dynamic way.

---

## üí° Idea & Concept  
Born out of the need to reduce repetitive inquiries in the **Project Controls** and **IT** departments, the project began with a simple set of static responses. With high demand and complexity, it evolved into a powerful **AI-powered agent**, capable of dynamic querying, API integration, and multi-channel availability.

Key Goals:
- Help employees access information from internal systems without manual requests.
- Allow interaction from Teams and directly within internal web platforms.
- Automatically trigger backend actions (like data syncing or status checks) using secure APIs and Power Automate.
